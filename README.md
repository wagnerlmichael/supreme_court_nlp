## Data Cleaning

This project involved multiple data cleaning/data wrangling steps. These scripts can be found in

* `/text_cleaning/flattener_with_filter.ipynb`
* `/text_cleaning/utterance_flattener.ipynb`

The flattener_with_filter.ipynb takes the convokit overall case information jsonl file (with win side, judge vote records, etc.) and unpacks the nested dictionaries into a csv file containing columns we planned to use for our models which can then be joined with the utterance data that is created and joined together the utterance_flattener.ipynb notebook.

The utterance flattener notebook output is the csv files that can be found in the `data` directory.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Our exploratory data analysis is found in the `/eda` directory with some key notebooks listed here:
* `/eda/sentiment_baseline.ipynb`
* `/eda/summary_stats.ipynb`
* `/eda/eda.ipynb`
* `/eda/new_baselines.ipynb`

## Helper Functions

While we originally intended to abstract all repetitive functions into helpers, we were only able to do this for models that were done locally (i.e. bag of words models) given difficulties in syncing Google Collab and Github.

The helper functions for bag of words models are in the `/src` directory.

## Modeling

We ran multiple NLP models, which can be found in the `modeling` directory. Each model received its own notebook as noted in the titles of the notebooks. All were run in Google Collab with the exception of the `bow`, `cbow`, and `sentiment_judge` given size of data and number of epochs.

* `bert.ipynb`
* `bigbird.ipynb`
* `bow.ipynb`
* `cbow.ipynb`
* `longformer.ipynb`
* `Roberta.ipynb`
* `Roberta_NotRandom.ipynb`
* `sentiment_judge.ipynb`

## Results

Our `results` directory contains our final report and poster for the project. The poster can be found below:
